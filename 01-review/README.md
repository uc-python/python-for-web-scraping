# Module Template

This repo serves as the basis for new education slideshow modules that I build.

Right now, I'm using a [fork](https://github.com/eswan18/remarker2) of [`remarker`](https://github.com/tylerdave/remarker), in which I've added the ability to stitch multiple "sections" together into a single slideshow.

On a Unix-y system, build your presentation with:
```bash
make slides
```

Simply open the produced `slides.html` in your browser to see the slides.
