# The Tools -- Python and Jupyter

---

# Python

- Python is an extremely popular programming language.

- Known for **readability** and **versatility**.

- "The second-best language for everything"
  - Although it's the *most* popular language for data science, and maybe for web scraping too.

- Has a huge, rich ecosystem of third-party packages that act as "add-ons", giving it the ability to do even more.

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- Most coders like to work in an environment that has special tools to make programming easier:

  - Syntax highlighting

  - Ability to run code easily

  - Visualization of code outputs

---

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- There are hundreds (or more) of IDEs that support Python.

- However, the most popular right now are:

  - JupyterLab

  - VSCode

  - PyCharm

  - Vim

# JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

- JupyterLab is most popular among data scientists.

- It uses a special type of Python file called a **Jupyter notebook**.

  - Other editors use the more traditional Python format of "script" file.

- Notebooks are special because:

  - They allow you to store code in discrete chunks to mark logical boundaries

  - They support inline *markdown*, or stylized text, that allow the user to explain the code inline.

  - They can render complex outputs (like charts), and show results immediately after the code that produced them.

- Because of their ability to show visuals, notebooks are ideal for data exploration. They also tend to produce more readable, shareable code -- especially in the case of analysis code.
