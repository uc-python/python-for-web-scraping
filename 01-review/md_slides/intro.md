# Review of Basic Python for Data Science

---

# Agenda

1. The Tools -- Python and Jupyter

2. Pandas Series and DataFrames

3. Basic Data Wrangling

---

# Goals

1. Students will be comfortable performing basic data manipulation on tabular datasets using Pandas.

---

# Prerequisite Knowledge

1. Students should know how to run Python code on their own computers, either within Jupyter Notebooks, from another interactive development environment, or via the command line.

2. Students should already be familiar with most of the concepts covered -- this section is intended as review.

## The Tools -- Python and Jupyter

---

# Python

- Python is an extremely popular programming language.

- Known for **readability** and **versatility**.

- "The second-best language for everything"
  - Although it's the *most* popular language for data science, and maybe for web scraping too.

- Has a huge, rich ecosystem of third-party packages that act as "add-ons", giving it the ability to do even more.

---

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- Most coders like to work in an environment that has special tools to make programming easier:

  - Syntax highlighting

  - Ability to run code easily

  - Visualization of code outputs

---

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- There are hundreds (or more) of IDEs that support Python.

- However, the most popular right now are:

  - JupyterLab

  - VSCode

  - PyCharm

  - Vim

---

# JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

- JupyterLab is most popular among data scientists.

- It uses a special type of Python file called a **Jupyter notebook**.

  - Other editors use the more traditional Python format of "script" file.

- Notebooks are special because:

  - They allow you to store code in discrete chunks to mark logical boundaries

  - They support inline *markdown*, or stylized text, that allow the user to explain the code inline.

  - They can render complex outputs (like charts), and show results immediately after the code that produced them.

- Because of their ability to show visuals, notebooks are ideal for data exploration. They also tend to produce more readable, shareable code -- especially in the case of analysis code.
