# Review of Basic Python for Data Science

---

# Agenda

1. The Tools -- Python and Jupyter

2. Basic Python

3. Pandas DataFrames

4. Selecting, Indexing, and Filtering

5. Summarizing Data

---

# Goals

1. Students will be comfortable performing basic data manipulation on tabular datasets using Pandas.

---

# Prerequisite Knowledge

1. Students should know how to run Python code on their own computers, either within Jupyter Notebooks, from another interactive development environment, or via the command line.

2. Students should already be familiar with most of the concepts covered -- this section is intended as review.

## #1
# The Tools -- Python and Jupyter

---

# Python

- Python is an extremely popular programming language.

- Known for **readability** and **versatility**.

- "The second-best language for everything"
  - Although it's the *most* popular language for data science, and maybe for web scraping too.

- Has a huge, rich ecosystem of third-party packages that act as "add-ons", giving it the ability to do even more.

---

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- Most coders like to work in an environment that has special tools to make programming easier:

  - Syntax highlighting

  - Ability to run code easily

  - Visualization of code outputs

---

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- There are hundreds (or more) of IDEs that support Python.

- However, the most popular right now are:

  - JupyterLab

  - VSCode

  - PyCharm

  - Vim

---

# JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

- JupyterLab is most popular among data scientists.

- It uses a special type of Python file called a **Jupyter notebook**.

  - Other editors use the more traditional Python format of "script" file.

- Notebooks are special because:

  - They allow you to store code in discrete chunks to mark logical boundaries

  - They support inline *markdown*, or stylized text, that allow the user to explain the code inline.

  - They can render complex outputs (like charts), and show results immediately after the code that produced them.

- Because of their ability to show visuals, notebooks are ideal for data exploration. They also tend to produce more readable, shareable code -- especially in the case of analysis code.

# Basic Data Types

--

- **integers** (`int`): Whole numbers, positive or negative or zero

  - e.g. `3`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`0`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`-531`

--

- **floats** (`float`): Decimal numbers

  - e.g. `3.14`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`0.0004`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`-878.482`

--

- **strings** (`str`): Arbitrary text

  - e.g. `"hello"`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`'my name is ethan'`,&nbsp;&nbsp;""

--

- **booleans** (`bool`): Logical values `True` and `False`

  - `True`,&nbsp;&nbsp;`False` -- that's it


---

# Container Types

- Python also has some objects that can "contain" others...

---

# Container Types

**lists** (`list`): Ordered, 1-dimensional sequences of objects

  - Elements may be different types of things.

--

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 3, 84.51, False]

# Elements can be accessed by index (which counts from 0!):
my_list[1]
```
```
"b"
```

---

# Container Types


**dictionaries** (`dict`): Mappings from "keys" to "values", good for looking up entries by their key
  
--

```python
my_dict = {
  'address': '123 Oak Street',
  'city': 'Chicago',
  'bedrooms': 2,
  'bathrooms': 1,
  'rent': 1599.99
}

# Values can be "looked up" by key
my_dict['bedrooms']
```
```
2
```

---

# Other Types

- There are many many more data types in Python that you may hear about, but these (along with DataFrames, covered next) are the ones we'll mostly be using.

- The general term for a Python "thing" (of any type) is an **object**.

# Pandas DataFrames

---

# Pandas

- The Pandas package is the backbone of data analysis in Python

- Pandas is all about **DataFrames**, objects that store tabular data

  - The package was originally developed by financial analysts who wanted to do data analysis in Python, but needed an abstraction similar to DataFrames from the R language to do so.

- The funny name is short for **Pan**el **Da**ta

---

# DataFrames -- Basics

- DataFrames are tabular data

  - Think: DataFrames in R, tables in SQL, Datasets in SAS

- DataFrames have **column names** and **row indices**

<img src="assets/basic_dataframe.png" style="width:100%;"/>

- We'll use this DataFrame of planes for many of our examples in this section.

---

# DataFrames -- Basics

In most situations, DataFrames just render as text:

```
  tailnum    year                     type      manufacturer      model engines  seats  speed     engine
0  N10156  2004.0  Fixed wing multi engine           EMBRAER  EMB-145XR       2     55    NaN  Turbo-fan
1  N102UW  1998.0  Fixed wing multi engine  AIRBUS INDUSTRIE   A320-214       2    182    NaN  Turbo-fan
2  N103US  1999.0  Fixed wing multi engine  AIRBUS INDUSTRIE   A320-214       2    182    NaN  Turbo-fan
3  N104UW  1999.0  Fixed wing multi engine  AIRBUS INDUSTRIE   A320-214       2    182    NaN  Turbo-fan
4  N10575  2002.0  Fixed wing multi engine           EMBRAER  EMB-145LR       2     55    NaN  Turbo-fan
```

But in JupyterLab, DataFrames have a stylized representation:

# DataFrames -- Importing Data

- Easy to read in data from common formats (CSV, JSON, SQL databases)

- `pd.read_csv`, `pd.read_json`, `pd.read_excel`, `pd.read_sql` are several of the many options for importing data.

  - When reading from a flat file, just pass in the path to the file.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data/my_data.csv')


df = pd.read_json('data/my_data.json')


df = pd.read_excel('data/my_spreadsheet.xlsx')


# SQL tables require first creating a connection to the database, which varies by type of DB
df = pd.read_sql('my_table', db_connection) 
```

- Other formats Pandas can read: parquet, fixed-width text, feather, Stata, SAS, pickle, HDF5

- Also can read from the web, which we'll come back to: **`pd.read_html`**

---

# DataFrames -- Inspecting Data

`df.head()` is usually the place to start -- returns the first 5 rows
<br><br><br><br>

```python
planes_df.head()
```

<img src="assets/basic_dataframe.png" style="width:100%;"/>

---

# DataFrames -- Inspecting Data

Other options...

```python
planes_df.shape # Return (n_rows, n_columns)
```

```
(3322, 9)
```

```python
planes_df.columns # Return column names
```

```
Index(['tailnum', 'year', 'type', 'manufacturer', 'model', 'engines', 'seats',
       'speed', 'engine'],
      dtype='object')
```

---

# DataFrames -- Inspecting Data

`df.info()` gives a comprehensive overview, ideal when working interactively.

```python
planes_df.info()
```

```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 3322 entries, 0 to 3321
Data columns (total 9 columns):
 #   Column        Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------        --------------  -----  
 0   tailnum       3322 non-null   object 
 1   year          3252 non-null   float64
 2   type          3322 non-null   object 
 3   manufacturer  3322 non-null   object 
 4   model         3322 non-null   object 
 5   engines       3322 non-null   int64  
 6   seats         3322 non-null   int64  
 7   speed         23 non-null     float64
 8   engine        3322 non-null   object 
dtypes: float64(2), int64(2), object(5)
memory usage: 233.7+ KB
```

---

# DataFrames -- Exporting Data

- Pandas can save data in most of the formats it supports importing from.

- Instead of `pd.read_FILETYPE`, it's usually `df.to_FILETYPE`

```python
df.to_csv('data/my_data.csv')


df.to_json('data/my_data.json')


# Again, you need an existing database connection to work with SQL.
df.to_sql('my_table', db_connection)
```


- We'll probably mostly save data in CSVs in this course, for simplicity.

# Selecting, Indexing, and Filtering

---

# Subsetting Data

- Before you do much else, you need to be able to get at pieces of a DataFrame that you're interested in.

- This usually means limiting to certain columns, to certain rows, or both at the same time.

---

# Selecting

- Subsetting data by its columns is often called **selecting**

  - You might say "select the name column from the data"

- The syntax to select a single column is `df[column_name]`

  - This returns a **series** object, a 1-dimensional Pandas object

  - Series are a lot like Python lists, except all the data in them is usually of the same type

---

# Selecting

```python
planes_df['seats']
```
```
0        55
1       182
2       182
3       182
4        55
       ... 
3317    100
3318    142
3319    100
3320    142
3321    142
Name: seats, Length: 3322, dtype: int64
```
<br>

- Remember, this isn't a DataFrame, it's a Series

  - One way to tell is the bottom line, which says the name of the column, the length (number of entries), and the type of the elements in it.

---

# Selecting

- Selecting multiple columns is done with double brackets

  - The inner brackets indicate to Pandas that you're passing a *list of columns*

- Using double brackets returns a **DataFrame**, not a Series
  
  - You can even use double brackets with a single column if you don't want a Series

---

# Selecting

```python
planes_df[['seats', 'tailnum']]
```
```
      seats tailnum
0        55  N10156
1       182  N102UW
2       182  N103US
3       182  N104UW
4        55  N10575
...     ...     ...
3317    100  N997AT
3318    142  N997DL
3319    100  N998AT
3320    142  N998DL
3321    142  N999DN

[3322 rows x 2 columns]
```

---

# Selecting

- `['seats', 'tailnum']` is actually a list we pass into `planes_df[]`, which is why we get a 2-dimensional object (a DataFrame) back.

```python
columns = ['seats', 'tailnum']
planes_df[columns]
```
```
      seats tailnum
0        55  N10156
1       182  N102UW
2       182  N103US
3       182  N104UW
4        55  N10575
...     ...     ...
3317    100  N997AT
3318    142  N997DL
3319    100  N998AT
3320    142  N998DL
3321    142  N999DN

[3322 rows x 2 columns]
```

# Indexing

- "Indexing" is the word we use for subsetting rows based on their location or row label.

- Most things in Python index from 0.

  - That means an sequence with 3 elements would label them #0, #1, and #2.

- DataFrames have row indexes, as we've discussed before.

  - You can think of them as row labels.

  - By default, they're just integers from 0 to (number_of_rows - 1).

---

# Indexing

- Here, the indices are 0-4.

<img src="assets/basic_dataframe.png" style="width:100%;"/>

---

# Indexing

- Indices can be selected using `df.loc` and brackets.

```python
# Fetch the 3rd row (because we start counting at 0!)
planes_df.loc[2]
```
```
tailnum                          N103US
year                             1999.0
type            Fixed wing multi engine
manufacturer           AIRBUS INDUSTRIE
model                          A320-214
engines                               2
seats                               182
speed                               NaN
engine                        Turbo-fan
Name: 2, dtype: object
```

--

- Like selecting a single column, indexing a single row returns a **Series**, not a DataFrame.

  - Because, again, it's a 1-dimensional object.

---

# Indexing

- DataFrames can also be indexed with a *range*, instead of a single row index.

- This uses the same `df.loc` syntax, except a range is passed
  
  - `df.loc[starting_index:ending_index]`

```python
# Get rows at index 3 through index 6 (inclusive)
planes_df.loc[3:6]
```
```
  tailnum    year                     type      manufacturer      model  engines  seats  speed     engine

```

---

# Combining Selecting and Indexing

- You can select columns and index rows all at once using `df.loc[row_index, columns]`

```python
# Row indices 3-6, columns "seats" and "tailnum"
planes_df.loc[3:6, ['seats', 'tailnum']]
```
```
   seats tailnum
3    182  N104UW
4     55  N10575
5    182  N105UW
6    182  N107US
```

|:- |:- | 
| Select columns | `df[columns]` |
| Index rows | `df.loc[row_indices]` |
| Select columns *and* index rows | `df.loc[row_indices, columns]` |

---

# Filtering

- *Filtering* means limiting rows based on a condition of the data

  - e.g. "all rows where the number of engines is greater than 2"

- This is also done with `df.loc`, but you pass in an expression describing which rows to keep.

---

# Filtering

```python
# This syntax is a little clunky; the DataFrame name is specified twice.
planes_df.loc[planes_df['engines'] > 2]

# DataFrame-level Summaries

- If you want summaries of string/categorical columns instead, use `df.describe(include='object')`

```python
planes_df.describe(include='object')
```
```
       tailnum                     type manufacturer    model     engine
count     3322                     3322         3322     3322       3322
unique    3322                        3           35      127          6
top     N663AW  Fixed wing multi engine       BOEING  737-7H4  Turbo-fan
freq         1                     3292         1630      361       2750

# Column-level Summaries

- Series (remember, individual columns are Series objects) offer lots of summary options.

- Usually they're invoked as `df[column].SUMMARY()` and return a single, scalar value.

---

# Column-level Numeric Summaries

- `df[column].mean()`

- `df[column].max()`

- `df[column].min()`

- `df[column].quantile(q=0.5) # Median`

<br>
```python
planes_df['year'].min()
```
```
1956.0
```


---

# Column-level Categorical Summaries

- `df[column].nunique() # Number of unique values`

- `df[column].value_counts() # Number of occurrences of each value, descending`

<br>
```python
planes_df['engine'].nunique()
```
```
6
```

```python
planes_df['type'].value_counts()
```
```
Fixed wing multi engine     3292
Fixed wing single engine      25
Rotorcraft                     5
Name: type, dtype: int64
```

<br>
- Note that `value_counts` is an exception to the rule -- it doesn't return a single number, but instead a *Series*.

- Since this section is intended as review, there are no exercises.

- If you really want to brush up on basic Python, you can try the case study from UC's *Intro to Python* workshop (which I also teach):
