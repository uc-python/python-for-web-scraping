# HTML in the Browser

- Most (maybe all) browsers have a set of *Developer Tools*, which allow you to inspect various things about web pages

- These tools are invaluable when scraping the web; they help you track down elements that contain the info you want

- Right click on some text on the page and select *Inspect Element* or *Inspect*

  - This should be available out-of-the-box in Chrome and Firefox

  - In Safari, you'll have to enable it: go to Preferences > Advanced > Show develop menu in menu bar
