# Python for Web Scraping

### Course Description

TBD

### Objectives

1. **Students will be able to pull data from a simple website into Python and filter, sort, and aggregate it** (primary goal of the course).
2. Students will be able to explain the basics of how web pages are represented as HTML and list the common tools available in Python to convert that HTML into useful information.
3. Students will be able to articulate the differences between a static web page and a dynamic one. They will be able to explain, at a high level, how the selenium library can help parse dynamic pages and will know where to look for more information on selenium.
4. Students will be able to articulate the use cases that necessitate web crawlers. They will be able to explain, at a high level, how the scrapy library can be used to build web crawlers.

### Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with the core concepts of Python: assignments, if-statements, for-loops, using functions, and ideally writing functions as well.
Experience with Jupyter notebooks (or JupyterLab) and Pandas DataFrames will make the course easier but is not required.

### Format

The course content will be delivered via pre-recorded lectures, which I will release weekly in chunks of approximately 5 hours for 3 weeks.
I will also distribute some supplemental exercises to go along with the lectures, meant to take a few hours to complete.
We will meet live for 4 hours each Saturday during the course, 9am-1pm eastern.
During this time, I will briefly review the week's lectures; students are encouraged to use the remaining time to complete the exercises, as I and a TA will be available to answer questions and help with issues during this session.
